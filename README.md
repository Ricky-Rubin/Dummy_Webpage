# Dummy_Webpage

This project is a copy of an exercise on Odin's project. The project is meant to test 
and help you evaluate your knowledge of HTML and CSS and how goof you are with positioining,
which is basically CSS. 

I had fun replicating this landing page as I added some features of my own and learnt new things.
